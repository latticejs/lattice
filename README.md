# Lattice

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/latticejs/lattice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/latticejs/lattice) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/latticejs/lattice.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

**Custom React/Material UI Library**

## Install

You can install any Lattice component individually.

For example, let's install the Lattice widgets:

### With yarn

`yarn add @latticejs/widgets`

### With npm

`npm i @latticejs/widgets`

:heavy_plus_sign: Lattice components can be found at [packages](/packages).

_Note_: Lattice packages are scoped using `@latticejs`

## Getting Started

The easiest way to getting started with **Lattice** is using our CLI tool: `clap`

### Start from an official example 

:warning: *Lattice is currently being released using the `alpha` channel. This means you should consider adding the `@alpha` tag to point to the latest versions when installing.*

First, install `clap` if you don't have it yet.

`npm i -g @latticejs/clap@alpha`

Then, you can run:

`clap my-App`

This command will do the following:

- Create a directory called `my-App`.
- Download and install the default Lattice example.

See more about clap [here](/packages/clap).
